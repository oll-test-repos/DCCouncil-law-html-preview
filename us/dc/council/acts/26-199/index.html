Except as otherwise provided in paragraph (2)(B) of this subsection, the housing provider shall serve on the tenant a 30-day notice to vacate. If the person who was found to have performed an illegal act is someone occupying the premise other than the tenant, the tenant may be evicted only if the tenant knew or should have known that an illegal act was taking place. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to excuse a housing provider's unlawful retaliatory action or failure to comply with the Violence Against Women Act of 1994, approved September 13, 1994 (108 Stat. 1902; 34 U.S.C. § 12291 <em>et seq.</em>), or successor legislation, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, approved July 26, 1990 (104 Stat. 327; 42 U.S.C. § 12101 <em>et seq</em>.), Titles VIII and IX of the Civil Rights Act of 1968, approved April 11, 1968 (82 Stat. 81; 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3619, 3631), the Human Rights Act of 1977, effective December 13, 1977 (D.C.

                <p class="text-indent-4 quote">"<span class="level-num">(ii)</span> The tenant took reasonable steps to prevent the commission of violent criminal activity, such as requesting the housing provider remove the offending household member's name from the lease, reporting prior criminal activity to the police, seeking assistance from social services or counseling agencies, or denying permission, if feasible, for the offending household member to reside in the dwelling unit; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-4 quote">"<span class="level-num">(iii)</span> The tenant was a victim or intended victim of the criminal activity.</p>
