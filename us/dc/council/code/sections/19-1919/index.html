                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(8)(A)">(A)</span> The first-trust instrument expressly indicates an intent to qualify for the benefit or the first-trust instrument clearly is designed to enable the first trust to qualify for the benefit; and</p>

                <p class="text-indent-2 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(10)">(10)</span> An authorized fiduciary may not exercise the decanting power if a settlor objects in a signed record delivered to the fiduciary within the notice period and:</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(10)(A)">(A)</span> The first trust and a second trust are both grantor trusts, in whole or in part, the first trust grants the settlor or another person the power to cause the second trust to cease to be a grantor trust, and the second trust does not grant an equivalent power to the settlor or other person; or</p>
                <p class="text-indent-3 "><span class="level-num" id="(b)(10)(B)">(B)</span> The first trust is a nongrantor trust and a second trust is a grantor trust, in whole or in part, with respect to the settlor, unless:</p>
